# vue-interface

This project was created using vue.js.

Also, I used some libraries and dependencies such as:
- Bootstrap: To manage responsive design.
- FontAwesomeIcon: To use nice icons.
- Axios: To consume services.
- Lodash: To manipulate some data.

Design is simple and 100% responsive. 

You can , create new data, updated data, delete data and filter those data. Those actions are not persistent if you reload the page the changes will disappear. It´s just a short project to show how vue.js works.

You can find here how to use: mounted, watch, methods, $emit, props, axios, etc.

If you have any doubts about this project or any topics relative to coding please don´t hesitate to contact me.
